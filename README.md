# Sydney Tour
This is my **Musical Structure App** of [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).

## What is it about?
The main screen of the app displays a GridView of albums.
* A long press on an album displays a contextual menu allowing the user the option of either going to the album, buying it or adding it to the wishlist.
* A click on the Wishlist button will display the Wishlist screen where the user can see all the albums they have added to the wishlist. From there, the user can either remove an album from the wishlist, or also go to the album or buy it.

This app is not a full-fledged music shop application. The payment of an album is not implemented, neither is the playback of a song.

## IDE
* Android Studio 2.3.3

## Tested with
* Hardware Devices: Samsung SM-G935F (Android 7.0, API 24), LGE Nexus 5 (Android 6.0.1, API 23)
* Emulator and Virtual device: Nexus SX API 25
